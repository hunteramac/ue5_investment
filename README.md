A prototype project following what I've learned in previous ones. The intent is to build and apply a toolset to effectively create gameplay experiences with NPC social interaction.

Has important dependency of https://github.com/MothCocoon/FlowGraph

Currently, there's some flow nodes setup in a style similar to how The Witcher 3 REDKIT has internal scenes defined. They take in data tables which represent Screenplay. It's all text based right now.
