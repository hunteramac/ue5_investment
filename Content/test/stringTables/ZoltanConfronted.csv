Novigrad Streets outside Dandelion\'s Inn - Evening\r\nThe sun is setting on the city as Geralt works their way down the Novigrad street with Roach, leading the horse through the milling stream of passers by.\r\n\r\nThe Witcher spots their goal down the road some 50 paces away - Dandelion\'s inn with lights gleaming through windows.\r\n\r\nGeralt notices that outside the Inn, a trio of men encircles a dwarf - Zoltan - who stands on the raised performer platform with the inn at their back, leaning slightly on their battle axe\'s stave."
"igraph._Geralt_walks_up","The Witcher continues down the road, towards inn and the gathering out it\'s front door.\r\n\r\nGeralt can see that the one man in the center, well dressed some black silk getup and matching hat is currently speaking to Zoltan, though exact words lost in the bustle of the street.\r\nThe man has a sword belted to their waste, and the two more unsavory types - common street thugs have cudgels looped around.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf\'s face is impassive."
